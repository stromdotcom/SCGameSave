SCGameSave
==========

A reusable, serialized game save system for Unity

SCGameSave is a set of classes for Unity projects.  It includes a GameSaveContainer which manages multiple save files, and a GameSave which is a serializable class which can contain just about anything.

Variations of this save system have been used in my past 5 game projects.  This goal of this repo is to make the system reusable and extendable.
